      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized, I was trying to make an IMPRESSIVE game, rather than a FUN one (which probably says a lot about my insecurities).
I am NOT known for actually finishing my projects.
Contrary to popular belief, creativity is NOT a rare talent. It&amp;rsquo;s not even a minority trait. Literally everyone is able to come up with an abundance of ideas, some of which are actually quite practical and executable.</description>

      <description>I am Quin7et (pronounced &amp;ldquo;quintet&amp;rdquo;), a writer and a game developer.
I made Campfire for Ludum Dare 50. I translated this Devil Daggers guide by Braden. I have translated a few entries (into Chinese) on the SCP Foundation. I wrote a short fiction published on Science Fiction World when I was 17. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t link it. The reason being that I am not proud of it.</description>
