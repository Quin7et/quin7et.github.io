      <title>Virginia: Perfect In form, Lost In Spirit</title>

      <description>Preamble Eurogamer&amp;rsquo;s review of Thirty Flights of Loving states: &amp;ldquo;This is a game that packs more narrative punch into its first startling jump-cut than most can muster across an entire campaign.&amp;rdquo; Virginia, unfortunately, falls into the latter. Despite its effort to become Thirty Flight&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;full-length successor,&amp;rdquo; an overt ending credit tribute would not save Virginia from being a drawn-out, vapid hollow of its predecessor. Because of Virginia&amp;rsquo;s self-identification as an interactive movie rather than a game, it naturally fails to live up to Thirty Flight&amp;rsquo;s name - to push beyond the boundary of video game narrative techniques.</description>

      <description>That&amp;rsquo;s when I realized, I was trying to make an IMPRESSIVE game, rather than a FUN one (which probably says a lot about my insecurities).
I am NOT known for actually finishing my projects.
Contrary to popular belief, creativity is NOT a rare talent. It&amp;rsquo;s not even a minority trait. Literally everyone is able to come up with an abundance of ideas, some of which are actually quite practical and executable.</description>

      <description>I am Quin7et (pronounced &amp;ldquo;quintet&amp;rdquo;), a writer and a game developer.
I made Campfire for Ludum Dare 50. I translated this Devil Daggers guide by Braden. I have translated a few entries (into Chinese) on the SCP Foundation. I wrote a short fiction published on Science Fiction World when I was 17. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably noticed that I didn&amp;rsquo;t link it. The reason being that I am not proud of it.</description>
