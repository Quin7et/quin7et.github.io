[{"content":"\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat\u0026rsquo;s when I realized, I was trying to make an IMPRESSIVE game, rather than a FUN one (which probably says a lot about my insecurities).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI am NOT known for actually finishing my projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContrary to popular belief, creativity is NOT a rare talent. It\u0026rsquo;s not even a minority trait. Literally everyone is able to come up with an abundance of ideas, some of which are actually quite practical and executable. The hard part is to, well, do something about it. This eliminates around half of the population. The harder part is to see it through - to finish/release your project. This eliminates 99% of the rest.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTill today, I have an astounding number of \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTWO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e (barely) finished games, both of which are jam games. Also both of them are made this year. I have been \u0026ldquo;developing\u0026rdquo; games since 2019. It took me 2 and a half year just to learn to have the courage and patience to finish a project. Though I am overwhelmingly positive that an actually functional human being would find it trivially easy to be significantly more productive than me - and we both know what \u0026ldquo;functional human beings\u0026rdquo; are like - I haven\u0026rsquo;t really encountered much of these guys. So\u0026hellip; I guess we are just all intrinsically lazy\u0026hellip;?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyways. My ADHD brain is drifting off.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI\u0026rsquo;ve been pretty nervous about the idea of asking \u003ca href=\"https://foursay.itch.io/\"\u003eFoursay\u003c/a\u003e (a fellow game dev, my collage roommate) to collaborate in the jam. We were in LD46 (2020) and I got carried. I was incompetent to say at best. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know what a raycast is. I was at pretty much the lowest and loneliest point of my life so far, so I had zero productivity. Naturally, as considerate as he is, he didn\u0026rsquo;t talk about it and was silently reluctant to work with me on anything after LD46. His caution was well justified.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t until after I return to collage from my gap year, failed a mandatory course because I wasn\u0026rsquo;t immediately good at the subject upon introduction and lost motivation, realized I am the sole reason of my own downfall, retook the course and got an A, did I learn the most valuable lesson I\u0026rsquo;ve learned at collage: \u003cstrong\u003eFUCKING PRESS ON\u003c/strong\u003e. Uninspired moments, or even prolonged slough are common occurrence in even as small as a jam game project. Passion is unreliable. The best way to do things is to just do them. In order to improve, you need to at least make something to improve upon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter graduation, I participated in LD50. The goal was simple: finish the game. I aimed for a interactive novel because I\u0026rsquo;m a somewhat competent writer (also it\u0026rsquo;s easy to develop). I went easy on myself and joined the jam category (72 hours). It was 3 gruesome days, but \u003ca href=\"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/50/campfire\"\u003eI pulled it off\u003c/a\u003e. Then I called Foursay and we played each other\u0026rsquo;s game. Here\u0026rsquo;s how the game did:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003cthead\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003cth style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/image-20220720043837143.png\" alt=\"Scores\" title=\"Scores\"\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/thead\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"text-align:center\"\u003eHow the game did\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI think the game worked as a validation of elementary skill in game development. When I asked Foursay to collab in the GMTK game jam, he agreed.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe had no idea what he was roped into.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n\u003cthead\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003cth style=\"text-align:center\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/image-20220720024740503.png\" alt=\"The unnecessarily complicated system\" title=\"The unnecessarily complicated system\"\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/thead\u003e\n\u003ctbody\u003e\n\u003ctr\u003e\n\u003ctd style=\"text-align:center\"\u003eThe totally unnecessarily complicated system\u003c/td\u003e\n\u003c/tr\u003e\n\u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe theme this year is\u0026hellip; rigid? We were expecting something that \u003cem\u003esuggests\u003c/em\u003e about the potential gameplay rather than \u0026ldquo;Roll of the Dice\u0026rdquo; which just screams randomness? So in an attempt to revolt against this, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to make a dice game with zero randomness. Here\u0026rsquo;s what I came up with:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA turn based game where you play as a rolling D6, crash enemies with your 6 different faces. The damage you do is the number on the face you crush enemy with, and your health in the current round is the number on the top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI mean, one mechanic to tie movement, offence and defense together, how can it be any better? Also opposite faces on D6 always add up to 7 - the game balances itself! FS came up with a rhythm game where your dice roll decides the beats (which in retrospect might just be more fun) but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t convinced that the idea would land. It\u0026rsquo;s GMTK! We need innovation, not fun! FS being FS indulged me with this and we soon began development.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTBC\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":null,"permalink":"https://quin7et.github.io/posts/the-gmtk-gamejam-2022-experience/","title":"Things I Learned From the GMTK Game Jam"},{"content":"\u003cp\u003eI am Quin7et (pronounced \u0026ldquo;quintet\u0026rdquo;), a writer and a game developer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI made \u003ca href=\"https://quin7et.itch.io/campfire\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eCampfire\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for Ludum Dare 50.

I use C# for most of my projects. I believe good characters and plot is more important than setting. My favorite musician is Shostakovich. I find it terrifying that Cyberpunk is still relevant today after 40 years. I am an INTP, if it at all matters. I think capitalism is built upon a depressing premise and we, as a compassionate specie, can do better.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eCereal is not soup. Hotdogs are not sandwich.
