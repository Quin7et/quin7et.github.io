<p>Eurogamer&rsquo;s review of <em>Thirty Flights of Loving</em> states: &ldquo;This is a game that packs more narrative punch into its first startling jump-cut than most can muster across an entire campaign.&rdquo; <em>Virginia,</em> unfortunately, falls into the latter. Despite its effort to become <em>Thirty Flight&rsquo;s</em> &ldquo;full-length successor,&rdquo; an overt ending credit tribute would not save <em>Virginia</em> from being a drawn-out, vapid hollow of its predecessor. Because of <em>Virginia&rsquo;s</em> self-identification as an interactive movie rather than a game, it naturally fails to live up to <em>Thirty Flight&rsquo;s</em> name - to push beyond the boundary of video game narrative techniques.</p>
<p>Minor spoilers ahead.</p>
<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>
<p>Before criticizing <em>Virginia</em>, let&rsquo;s have a look at its pioneer.</p>
<p>Similar to the imitation of stage drama in the early days of film art, video games&rsquo; practice of cinematic language is still at a primitive &ldquo;borrowing&rdquo; stage. Symptoms are abundant: <em>Order 1886&rsquo;s</em> unnecessary forced letterboxing and Telltale games&rsquo; non-existent gameplay and unimportant story choices, to name a few. These practices are just like Georges Mérieux&rsquo;s screen drama - dividing films into sets without the need to change the actual setting, a single static camera positioned at the auditorium, etc. Existing techniques and traditions are carried over without contextual adaptation or refactoring. As AAA production costs continue to rise, industry leaders are increasingly unwilling to risk innovating in a field where established solutions are readily available.</p>
<p>When AAA fails, indies come to the rescue. Blendo Games, the one-man studio led by Brendon Chung, launched <em>Thirty Flights of Loving</em> in 2012 to immediate critical acclaim. As the title of The Verge&rsquo;s review claims: &ldquo;<em>Thirty Flights of Loving</em> shows how little we still know about the language of games,&rdquo; <em>Thirty Flight&rsquo;s</em> application of smash cuts to the video game media is undoubtedly novel.</p>
<p>Most first-person games utilize level-long single-take gameplay sections combined with cinematic cutscenes where players have zero control. Games like <em>Half-Life 2</em> completely abolished loading screens, making every level connect seamlessly. Its strategy of never changing perspective nor taking control away from the player boosts immersion, but excessive freedom renders scripted content less effective. On the contrary, Supermassive or Telltale games are highly scripted and mix long, predetermined sequences of cinematic shots with short bursts of playable content. This approach is, of course, more akin to traditional films rather than interactive media.</p>
<p><em>Thirty Flights</em> works because it caught the essence of what makes both of the former types of games great. The immersion of Half-Life 2 is not a result of an uncut game-long take but the continuity and mechanical consistency of the experience. In the two teleporter sequences - one in Kleiner&rsquo;s lab and the other in Nova Prospekt - spatial and time continuity were respectively broken, but the jump was never jarring nor disorienting. The player&rsquo;s relative continuity felt intact because their perspective stayed consistent, and their control was never taken away. Similar to how the sense of controlling a first-person character is unique to video games, editing is, more than anything, a measure unique to cinema. Subtle information conveyed simply by compounding shots exists in no other places. Conveniently, a particular editing technique can be applied to first-person games without constantly changing perspective or limiting player control - the smash cut. Well-executed smash cuts already retain certain aspects of the shot through the jump, such as shot composition, motion, sound, etc. As shown in <em>Thirty Flights</em>, these abstract connections not only work perfectly with first-person games&rsquo; continuity of perspective and control, they can also abtain new meanings from gameplay elements.</p>
<p>For example, after the wedding scene, the forward movement of the player walking towards the bedded Anita coincides with the movement of the player jumping down the ventilation pipe in the next shot. After the fall, the player must hold the forward key to approach injured Anita, and this action of pressing the forward key again coincides with the action of pushing Borges forward in the next shot. Not only is the entire movement continuous visually, the player&rsquo;s actions are also inherited to the next shot. The triggering of the cuts is well thought out as well. The cuts are triggered solely by the player&rsquo;s movement, position, and perspective, rather than a cut-scene-inducing button. The player can trigger a cut simply by walking down a hallway. As in films, the absolute timing of cuts is not telegraphed to the player. By guiding the player&rsquo;s unconscious behavior to fit the narrative, <em>Thirty Flights</em> produces contextual editing without ever taking control away from the player.</p>
<p>The cut that truly elevated <em>Thirty Flights</em>, in my opinion, is the last (the penultimate, if you went through the museum) cut: Facing the oncoming truck, the player and the police car driven by Borges collides head-on, and with the sound of glass shattering, the player is thrown directly into the museum scene as if flying out of the windshield. Forward momentum from the crash then brings the player to a display board that writes &ldquo;the end.&rdquo; Just like that, the whole game ends in less than 15 minutes, everything concludes with a poetical abruptness. If the player turns around, the police car and the broken windshield they just crashed through are still in mid-air, behind them, like an exhibit. The sense of momentum brought by Quake movement - an intuition shared by all old-school fps players - serves as the retained element across smash cut shots. An instinct uniquely belongs to the media of games (controlled momentum) is used to connect two shots in a technique uniquely belongs to the media of film (smash cut) - that&rsquo;s how a true adaptation of techniques is done.</p>
<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>After analyzing <em>Thirty Flights</em>, let&rsquo;s look at where Virginia is missing.</p>
<p>First, the impression given by the opening scene is unimpressive: the protagonist needs to finish makeup in front of the mirror, and the player action required to do that is - a click of the left mouse button. That&rsquo;s right - you need to aim at your bag, click the left mouse button to take out the lipstick, click the left mouse button to apply it, and click the left mouse button to put it back. Within a few clicks, the only controllable element you currently have in this game - your camera - is hijacked. Compared with the wedding scene of <em>Thirty Flights</em>, even during the drinking sequence, the player still maintains (albeit at a restricted angle) camera control. Pre-sequenced cuts plays on by themselves, with no player input regarded. Buttons, animations, and scene switches are done essentially the same as traditional cutscenes, except replacing loading screens with smash cuts.</p>
<p>The developers&rsquo; strong urge to control the narrative experience further compresses the interaction opportunities between the player and the game.  Judging from the excessive number of music cue cuts, it&rsquo;s likely that the soundtrack recorded by the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra costs too large of a budget to the developers&rsquo; liking. The editing seems to have no regard for the player&rsquo;s pace, instead insisting on being in sync with the music cue, which often results in players having nothing to do in certain scenes or not having enough time to read through critical texts, which immensely harms the pacing. In the scene where the chief hands over the internal affairs investigation document to the protagonist, the game leaves the player with a measly 10 seconds to read this key document that will govern the entire story - just to match the cut with a music cue. While in the taxi scenes, the staircase scenes (the production team loves to jump cut on the stairs, even the stairs in the library that only take 10 seconds to walk up; but this particular cut may merely be an excuse to hijack the player&rsquo;s control, because the game then directly transition into a cutscene) and the restaurant scenes, the player will be at a loss in the face of awkward and idle pauses, thinking &ldquo;did I do something wrong?&rdquo; while waving the mouse looking for interaction prompts.  The dissolve from the statue photo to the statue body (very 90s, but horribly executed) did not even unify the position and orientation of the statue in the two shots, which is a huge missed opportunity. Sadly, the reason may be that a unified frame position requires the camera to be under the statue, and the player must stay obediently in the car.</p>
<p>Similar to <em>Thirty Flights</em>, <em>Virginia</em> contains no dialogue, and instead relies on environmental storytelling, frame composition, and visuals to tell the story. Unfortunately, despite its general quality, <em>Virginia&rsquo;s</em> visuals lack character, giving off a lifeless feeling. Players familiar with Brendon&rsquo;s &ldquo;80s Cyberpunk&rdquo; trilogy are usually well impressed by his unique art style: extremely low-resolution lightmap (or no GI altogether), extremely low-poly models, disproportionally detailed texture design, and a massive number of hidden easter eggs. <em>Virginia,</em> however, uses generic palette shading with little surface detail expressed in textures, and only a few crucial documents and signs with text or readable detail. Seeing the blank documents on the entire bulletin board in the police station, I can&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for the excellent environmental storytelling opportunity missed by the developers. Seeing the blank documents on the entire bulletin board in the police station, I can&rsquo;t help but feel sorry for the excellent environmental storytelling opportunity missed by the developers. This lack of scene detail is in turn related to Virginia&rsquo;s rigid rhythm. In <em>Thirty Flights</em>, almost no cuts were made regardless of player intention, including the tense airport escape. In fact, in the escape sequence, the urge players felt is solely the result of the music score. Players can stop at any time to appreciate the dozens of unique handmade billboards in the corridor, and the game never forces you onward. However, even when similar free exploration scenes appear in Virginia, the details of the environmental storytelling are sometimes not refined. The medical equipment, posters, and general sense of life in Maria&rsquo;s home stand remarkable, while the brief exploration of the observatory hall has only one collectible flower as a reward, with no clear guidance for the stairs to advance the plot.</p>
<p><em>Virginia&rsquo;s</em> story is also lackluster. There is nothing wrong with choosing to adapt real FBI cases, but <em>Virginia&rsquo;s</em> delivery is a bit self-satisfying, and from time to time, its tone will confuse players who do not know much about post-Cold War American culture. Complicated conflicts involving the conservative white community, post-Cold War political environment, and FBI internal affairs investigation often require contextual support; a mime-style delivery will inevitably encounter difficulties. Rubbing salt in the wound, the protagonist&rsquo;s actions carried very little stake. What is her reason for stubbornly insisting on seeing through the internal investigation? Asking players to sympathize with her just from her being a minority or her shaky hands when putting on lipstick is not realistic. Subsequently, her final choice to forego the investigation loses the narrative punch it&rsquo;s supposed to deliver.</p>
<p>The story is filled with symbolic imagery, but the quality of delivery is uneven. The imagery at the beginning of the game - a combination of a tape drive, the father on life support, the secret box, the broken key, and the incinerator - represents the FBI’s deep-buried secrets. It&rsquo;s a great combination of metaphors for an opening, but the crucial object that carried out the transition - the tape drive - perplexingly never appeared again. What is the intention of it? Is it just a one-time asset to create a parallel (the button presses and the beeping sounds) between the tape drive and the alarm clock, manifesting a surreal feeling? On the contrary, a few constantly used imagery, namely the red bird and the bison, were overly &ldquo;hand-holding.&rdquo; In the night road driving shots, the same frame compositions were used repeatedly, attempting to link the vehicle of the metaphor with the tenor, while the average player must&rsquo;ve already picked it up. Did the protagonist&rsquo;s first out-of-body experience in his sleep express a dissociated emotion, or was it just laying the groundwork for introducing the menacing red door? The imagery in the game is more or less uncertain about themselves. Except for the two major imageries (bird and bison), the implications are often ambiguous, leaving any interpretation unsatisfying.</p>
<h2 id="the-ugly">The Ugly</h2>
<p>As a walking simulator, <em>Virginia</em> is above average. Whether it is to be judged as an independent game or an independent film, <em>Virginia&rsquo;s</em> script, art, framing, and music are all professionally done. However, if the developers openly invite players to associate it with <em>Thirty Flights</em> in the ending credits, they should prepare to be judged accordingly. <em>Virginia</em> did borrow the lack of dialogue, cinematic editing, and fixed first-person perspective of <em>Thirty Flights,</em> but it didn&rsquo;t seem to utilize the elements that make these traits work. The absence of dialogue <em>needs</em> detailed environmental storytelling to fill in the gaps; disorienting smash cut <em>needs</em> gameplay-level continuity to feel fluid, and immersion needs not only a constant perspective but an uninterrupted state of control.</p>
<p>As stated at the beginning, <em>Virginia</em> self-identifies as a film, so everything it does is, consciously or unconsciously, limited by the traditional film media. <em>Virginia</em> does not lack boldness or artistic expression. In fact, the whole game is full of stylized surreal elements. The reoccurring red door, the resurrected bird, the protagonist&rsquo;s &ldquo;spiritual experience&rdquo; and the thoroughly unreal cult scene - they are all well-crafted imageries. But none of these are unique to the media of games, while all of them can be done with traditional film production methods. It is not difficult for players who study the art of film to imagine how to set up and shoot the entire cult scene. But the &ldquo;crowd spinning and floating&rdquo; used by <em>Thirty Flights</em> to express drunkenness is a very gamified expression - simply increasing the Y coordinate (or Z, depending on the software) of the characters is sufficient - its inorganic stiffness directly contributes to the &ldquo;gamey&rdquo; feel. One might say that <em>Virginia</em> is going for the &ldquo;90s film feel&rdquo;, but blindly simulating the defects of the technologies in the era (it absurdly recommends 30fps!) is not equal to stylization - just as imitating the surface of a great game is not going to retain its core beauty.</p>
